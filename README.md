Working on developing programs for Classic Traveller

Have added the repository that I have been working on my Classic Traveller material.  
As suggested by a reader of my blog I have added this repository up for those who are
keen to take a look or help out with the project.

I am allowing free access for the time being and would appreciate it if someone could 
work on a GUI for the project.  It is my weak spot.  I want to release as a Java 
executable JAR file application and add the possibility of running it as an Applet as
well.  I am not too bad with Applet GUI's but it has been some time since I played with
an Application interface.

I use Eclipse Gallileo as my IDE so if I forget to uncheck the classpath files I 
apologise.  Remind me and I will remove them.

Cheers

Mark
